SPARQLr
=======
SARQLr is a Third Year Project created by Josh Nolan for The School of Computer Science, Manchester. 
You can find out more information about the project here: http://www.sparqlr.co.uk.

So what does SPARQLr do:
* An editor which allows you to write SPARQL queries and execute them against SPARQL endpoints and view the results.
* A repository of queries which users can view, learn and extend on
* Users can materialize queries into the SPARQLr triplestore which allows for further manipulation. Meaning that previously unlinked data between two sources can now be joined together!
* The creation of Integrated Sources which will reconcile the semantic differences in entities between datasources.

The codeset is a big ol' mess, but you might be able to decypher some of it - I will try and tidy it up at some point!
